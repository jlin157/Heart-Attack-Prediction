In this project, the goal is to predict the chance of a person suffering from a heart attack

The 12 algorithms used to analyze the data were:
        Decision Tree Classifier
        Logistic Regression Classifier
        Support Vector Classifier(SVC)
        Linear Discriminant Analysis Classifier(LDA)
        Quadratic Discriminant Analysis Classifier(QDA)
        K-Neighbors Classifier
        Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier(MLP)
        Naive Bayes Classifier
        Random Forest Classifier
        AdaBoost Classifier
        XGBoost Classifier
        Gradient Boosting Classifier

Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity and Time Taken for prediction were calculated
Further, we have also done feature selection by utilizing shap value and PCA.
